        "It recounts how the Order of Phaedra was founded in the "
        "early years of the kingdom, that courage might be tempered "
        "by wisdom and victory preserved through service.");

    addChapter("The Realm Newly Won",
        "When Eledhel was yet young and its stones still fresh laid,\n"
        "King Bregandil rode often beyond its walls. Though the\n"
        "enemy had been cast down and the banners of the realm now\n"
        "flew proudly above city and field, many dangers yet\n"
        "remained. Roads lay broken from war. Disputes arose among\n"
        "newly sworn lords. Villages looked to the Crown for justice\n"
        "as much as protection. The king's captains spoke often of\n"
        "fortresses and armies, yet Phaedriel perceived another\n"
        "truth. A kingdom was not secured by victories alone. What\n"
        "had been won by courage must be preserved by wisdom.\n"
        "Thus she turned her thoughts toward the future of the realm.");

    addChapter("The Counsel of the Sister",
        "It is said that Phaedriel came before her brother while the\n"
        "masons still labored upon the royal hall. There she spoke:\n"
        "'You have crossed the river and claimed a kingdom. Yet if\n"
        "our children inherit only walls and swords, then all this\n"
        "labor shall fade like mist before the morning sun. We must\n"
        "raise guardians not merely of the realm's borders, but of\n"
        "its purpose.' Bregandil listened well, for he trusted the\n"
        "judgment of his sister. Then he asked what form such\n"
        "guardians should take. Phaedriel answered: 'Let them be\n"
        "warriors when war is needed, judges when disputes arise,\n"
        "and servants of the Crown when duty calls. Let them be\n"
        "remembered not for power, but for fidelity.'");

    addChapter("The Gathering at Eledhel",
        "Word was sent throughout the kingdom. Captains came from\n"
        "the frontier, magistrates from the growing towns, and\n"
        "veterans who had crossed the Lonis beside Bregandil.\n"
        "Among them were men and women of many stations. Some had\n"
        "been born to noble houses, while others had earned their\n"
        "renown through hardship and faithful service. Phaedriel\n"
        "received them in the great square beneath the unfinished\n"
        "tower. There she spoke of duty, stewardship, and the burden\n"
        "of preserving what others had sacrificed to build. Many\n"
        "heard her words and pledged themselves before the Crown.");

    addChapter("The First Oath",
        "Upon the seventh day the chosen few assembled before king\n"
        "and court. A silver crown rested upon a table of oak, while\n"
        "before it lay a sword and a book of laws. Phaedriel bade\n"
        "them kneel and recite these words:\n"
        "'I shall place duty before glory.\n"
        "I shall place service before reward.\n"
        "I shall place the realm before myself.\n"
        "I shall stand faithful to oath and Crown.\n"
        "I shall leave Eledhel stronger than I found it.'\n"
        "Thus was the First Oath sworn. Those who spoke it became\n"
        "the first Companions of Phaedra.");

    addChapter("The Choosing of the Rose",
        "Many symbols were proposed for the new Order. Some favored\n"
        "the sword, recalling the wars of conquest. Others wished\n"
        "for the crown, signifying loyalty to the realm. Yet\n"
        "Phaedriel chose neither. Instead she selected the white\n"
        "rose. 'Steel wins the kingdom,' she declared, 'but peace\n"
        "allows it to flourish. Let this flower remind us of what\n"
        "we strive to protect.' Thereafter the white rose became\n"
        "the emblem of the Order. It was embroidered upon cloaks,\n"
        "engraved upon seals, and carried beside the banners of\n"
        "Eledhel wherever the Companions rode.");

    addChapter("The Judgment at Dor-Lonis",
        "Not long after the Order's founding, two lords disputed\n"
        "the ownership of lands reclaimed during the war. Their\n"
        "followers gathered in arms and bloodshed seemed certain.\n"
        "The newly sworn Companions rode to Dor-Lonis and heard the\n"
        "claims of both parties. Witnesses were called and records\n"
        "examined. After many days a settlement was reached that\n"
        "satisfied both houses and preserved the king's peace.\n"
        "There was no battle, no glory won by sword or spear, yet\n"
        "Phaedriel declared it among the Order's first victories.\n"
        "For the realm had been strengthened without a single life\n"
        "being lost.");

    addChapter("The Charge to Future Generations",
        "In later years, when the kingdom prospered and the fields\n"
        "beyond Eledhel grew green with harvest, Phaedriel spoke to\n"
        "the Order one final time. 'Remember always,' she said,\n"
        "'that kingdoms perish when pride outruns duty. You are not\n"
        "keepers of privilege, but guardians of trust. If ever the\n"
        "people fear their protectors more than their enemies, then\n"
        "our purpose shall have failed. Let your deeds be such that\n"
        "the lowliest farmer may look upon your banner and find\n"
        "comfort rather than dread.' Those words were recorded and\n"
        "preserved among the teachings of the Order.");

    addChapter("The Legacy of Phaedriel",
        "Phaedriel passed from the world in peace, honored by king\n"
        "and commoner alike. Yet the Order she founded endured.\n"
        "Through years of hardship and years of plenty, the\n"
        "Companions remained faithful to the principles she had\n"
        "established. They rode in defense of the realm, mediated\n"
        "disputes among its people, and upheld the laws of the\n"
        "Crown. Thus her memory endured not only in song or stone,\n"
        "but in every act of service performed in her name. And so\n"
        "it is said that while kings may found kingdoms, it is the\n"
        "faithful who preserve them.");
